# Source releases of SolOS
These releases are in Zip format. Some may be incomplete. As they are not complied into ISO images, you will need Python 3 to use these. Please do not
use these on your normal use computer, as they may be unstable. 

# How to use
Simply extract and run the startup, boot, or similar file in Python.

# More info
Do not download the .DS-Store file unless you are on a Mac. The reason it was uploaded is because I upload on my Mac. Strangely, the system doesn't work on a 
Mac. It will work on Linux and Windows. All bugs can be reported via the Issues section. If you are looking for a stable version, you should look in the os-installers repository on Github. If it doesn't exist, then it won't have been developed yet. The first stable release of SolOS will be the Version 1.2, and this will be released as a source release. The first ISO release will be 2.0.
